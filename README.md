# Prometheus task2 
1- How do I trigger a Prometheus alert?

    Define alerting rules: In Prometheus, i define alerting rules in a separate file called rules.yml or in the main configuration file, Each rule specifies a condition to be evaluated and a threshold to         trigger an alert.
  
2- What is the difference between node exporter and mysql exporter ?

    Node Exporter: is a general-purpose exporter that collects system-level metrics from a host machine. It provides information on CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic, and other system-level metrics.typically used to monitor the health and performance of a host machine.
    MySQL Exporter: is a specialized exporter that collects metrics from a MySQL database instance. It provides information on database performance, replication status, query execution, and other database-level metrics. MySQL Exporter can be used to monitor the health and performance of a MySQL database instance.

3- what is the maximum retention period to save data in Prometheus and how to increase it ?

    The maximum retention period to save data in Prometheus is determined by the size of the storage volume or disk space allocated for TSDB.

4- What are the different PromQL data types available in Prometheus Expression language?

    Matrices: are a collection of instant or range vectors that share the same metric name and set of labels. Matrices can be used to perform aggregations and calculations across multiple time-series data points.
    Scalars: are simple numeric values, such as integers or floating-point numbers so it can be used in arithmetic operations and comparisons.
    Strings: a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, can be used to match specific labels or filter results based on specific conditions.

5- How To calculate the average request duration over the last 5 minutes from a histogram ?

    will use rate() to calculate the average request duration during the last 5 minutes from a histogram called:

  rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])
/
  rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])

6- What is Thanos Prometheus?

    An open-source project that extends the capabilities of Prometheus, a popular monitoring and alerting system. Thanos provides a way to store, query, and visualize Prometheus metrics data over long-term storage by integrating with object storage systems like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

7- what is promtool and how i can use it ?

    A command-line tool provided by Prometheus that can be used to validate and alerting rules.
    Validating alerting rules: i can use promtool to validate your alerting rules file.

8- What types of Monitoring can be done via Grafana?

    Infrastructure monitoring: Grafana can be used to monitor the health and performance of my servers, network devices, and other infrastructure components-
    Application monitoring: Grafana can also be used to monitor the health and performance of my applications, including metrics such as response time and error rates.
    Database monitoring: Grafana can be used to monitor the performance of my databases, including metrics such as query execution times and connection counts.

9- Can we see different Servers CPU comparison in Grafana?

    Yes, Grafana can be used to compare CPU usage across different servers using a variety of visualization techniques
